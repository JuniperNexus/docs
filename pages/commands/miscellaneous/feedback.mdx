The `feedback` command allows users to send feedback about the bot to the bot owner using Juniper Nexus Bot.

## Command Usage

To send feedback about the bot, use the following command:

```
/feedback <message>
```

-   `<message>` (required): Your feedback message to the bot owner.

## Permissions

-   **Required Permissions**: None (available to all users).

## Command Behavior

-   Upon executing the command, the bot responds with a loading message while sending the feedback.
-   The bot retrieves the feedback message provided by the user.
-   The bot constructs an embedded message containing the feedback message, along with the user's username, discriminator, and ID.
-   The bot sends this embedded message directly to the bot owner specified in the environment configuration.
-   If the feedback is sent successfully, the bot notifies the user with a success message.
-   If an error occurs during execution (e.g., unable to send the message to the owner), the bot notifies the user with an error message.

## Example

To send feedback to the bot owner:

```
/feedback This bot is amazing! Keep up the good work!
```

## Notes

-   This command provides a direct channel for users to communicate their thoughts and suggestions about the bot to the bot owner.
-   Feedback messages are sent privately to the bot owner's Discord account specified in the environment configuration.
