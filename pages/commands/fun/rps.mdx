The `rps` command allows users to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the bot within your Discord server using Juniper Nexus Bot.

## Command Usage

To play Rock, Paper, Scissors, use the following command:

```
/rps
```

## Permissions

- **Required Permissions**: None (available to all users).

## Command Behavior

- Upon executing the command, the bot prompts the user to choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors using interactive buttons.
- The user has 15 seconds to select their choice. If they do not respond within this time, the bot informs them that they took too long to respond.
- After the user makes their choice, the bot randomly selects its own choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
- The bot then determines the winner based on the classic game rules:
  - Rock crushes Scissors
  - Scissors cuts Paper
  - Paper covers Rock
- The command responds with an embedded message displaying the user's choice, the bot's choice, and the result of the game (win, lose, or tie).

## Example

To play Rock, Paper, Scissors:

```
