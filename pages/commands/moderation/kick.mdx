The `kick` command allows moderators with appropriate permissions to kick a user from the server.

## Command Usage

To kick a user from the server, use the following command:

```
/kick @user [reason]
```

-   `@user`: Mention the user you want to kick.
-   `[reason]` (optional): Provide a reason for kicking the user.

## Permissions

-   **Required Permissions**: Kick Members (requires permission to kick members from the server).

## Command Behavior

-   Upon executing the command, the bot checks if it has the necessary permissions (`Kick Members`).
-   If the bot lacks permissions, it responds with an error message and takes no action (ephemeral message).
-   If the bot has permissions, it proceeds to kick the specified user from the server with the provided reason.
-   After kicking the user, it confirms the action with an embed message that includes the user's tag and the reason for kicking.

## Examples

1. To kick a user with the reason "Violating server rules":

```
/kick @username Violating server rules
```

2. To kick a user without specifying a reason:

```
/kick @username
```

## Notes

-   Use this command responsibly as kicking a user is a significant action.
-   Ensure that the bot has the necessary permissions (`Kick Members`) before attempting to use this command.
