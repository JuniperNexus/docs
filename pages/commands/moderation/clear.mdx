The `clear` command allows users with appropriate permissions to clear messages from a channel in your Discord guild.

## Command Usage

To clear messages from a channel, use the following command:

```
/clear [amount]
```

-   `[amount]` (optional): The number of messages to clear. Defaults to 100 if not specified.

## Permissions

-   **Required Permissions**: Manage Messages (requires permission to delete messages in the channel).

## Command Behavior

-   Upon executing the command, the bot attempts to clear the specified number of messages from the current channel.
-   It checks for the user's permissions and validates the input (`amount`) to ensure it's within valid ranges.
-   If successful, it deletes the messages and provides feedback on the number of messages cleared.
-   If any errors occur during the execution (e.g., insufficient permissions, channel not found), it displays an error message.

## Examples

1. To clear 50 messages from the channel:

```
/clear 50
```

2. To clear the default amount of 100 messages:

```
/clear
```

## Notes

-   Use this command responsibly as it permanently deletes messages from the channel.
-   Users must have the necessary permissions (`Manage Messages`) to use this command effectively.
