The `weather` command allows users to fetch and display current weather information and forecasts for a specified location using Juniper Nexus Bot.

## Command Usage

To check the weather for a location, use the following command format:

```
/weather <location>
```

- `<location>` (required): The location for which you want to fetch weather information.

## Permissions

- **Required Permissions**: None (available to all users).

## Command Behavior

- Upon executing the command, the bot responds with a loading message while fetching the weather information.
- The bot fetches the current weather data and forecast using an external API (`https://api.popcat.xyz/weather` in this case).
- If the location is valid and weather data is retrieved successfully, the bot displays an embedded message with:
  - Current weather details including temperature, sky conditions, feels-like temperature, humidity, and wind information.
  - A link to Google Maps pinpointing the specified location.
  - A forecast for the upcoming days including low and high temperatures and sky conditions.
- If there's an error fetching weather data or the location is not found, the bot informs that it failed to fetch weather information.

## Example

To check the weather for New York City:

```
/weather New York City
```

## Notes

- This command provides real-time weather updates and forecasts, enhancing user engagement within your Discord community.
- Ensure the specified location name is accurate to fetch the correct weather data.
