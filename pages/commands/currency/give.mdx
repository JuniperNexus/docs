The `give` command allows administrators to give coins to a specified user during events within your Discord server using Juniper Nexus Bot.

## Command Usage

To give coins to a user for a specific event, use the following command format:

```
/give <user> <amount> <event>
```

- `<user>` (required): Mention or specify the user to give coins to.
- `<amount>` (required): The amount of coins to give to the user.
- `<event>` (required): The name of the event associated with giving coins.

## Permissions

- **Required Permissions**: Administrator (default member permission).

## Command Behavior

- Upon executing the command, the bot responds with a loading message while processing the coin transaction.
- The command checks if the specified user exists in the database. If not found, it informs the user with an error message.
- It verifies if the specified event exists among available events. If the event is not found, it provides a list of available events.
- If both user and event are valid, the bot inserts a record of the coin transaction into the database, crediting the specified amount to the user's balance for the event.
- Upon successful transaction, the bot confirms with a success message indicating the amount of coins given to the user.

## Example

To give 100 coins to user @example for the event "Game Night":

```
/give @example 100 Game Night
```

## Notes

- This command is intended for use during events or special occasions within your Discord server to reward users with virtual currency.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions (`Administrator`) to use this command effectively.
