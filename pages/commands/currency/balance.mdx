The `balance` command allows users to check their balance and view transaction history within your Discord server using Juniper Nexus Bot.

## Command Usage

To check your balance and view transactions, use the following command format:

```
/balance [user]
```

-   `[user]` (optional): Mention or specify the user to check the balance for. If not provided, it defaults to the user who issued the command.

## Permissions

-   **Required Permissions**: None (available to all users).

## Command Behavior

-   Upon executing the command, the bot responds with a loading message while fetching the balance and transaction history.
-   If transactions are found for the user, the bot displays an embedded message showing the user's current balance and a list of recent transactions.
-   Pagination buttons (`previous` and `next`) allow users to navigate through multiple pages of transactions if needed.
-   The command supports fetching and displaying up to 10 transactions per page.

## Example

To check your own balance and transactions:

```
/balance
```

To check another user's balance and transactions (if permitted):

```
/balance @username
```

## Notes

-   This command is useful for managing virtual currency systems or tracking user activity within your Discord community.
-   If no transactions are found for the user, the bot informs that no transactions were found.

Use the `balance` command to stay informed about your financial activity within the Discord server managed by Juniper Nexus Bot.
