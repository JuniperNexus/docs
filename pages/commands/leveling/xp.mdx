title: XP
---

The `xp` command allows users to view their XP and level within your Discord guild using Juniper Nexus Bot.

## Command Usage

To view your XP and level, use the following command:

```
/xp [user]
```

- `[user]` (optional): Mention or specify the user to check the XP for. If not provided, it defaults to the user who issued the command.

## Permissions

- **Required Permissions**: None (available to all users within the guild).

## Command Behavior

- Upon executing the command, the bot responds with a loading message while fetching the user's XP and level.
- If the guild context is not available (e.g., if the command is executed outside a guild), the bot notifies that the command can only be used within guilds.
- The bot retrieves the user's XP and level information from the database.
- If the user is not found in the database, the bot notifies that the user was not found.
- The bot displays the user's username, level, XP, and time spent (converted to a readable format).

## Example

To view your own XP and level in the guild:

```
/xp
```

To view another user's XP and level (if permitted):

```
/xp @username
```

## Notes

- This command helps users track their XP progress and current level within the Discord guild.
- Users can see their level, XP earned, and time spent participating in activities within the guild.
