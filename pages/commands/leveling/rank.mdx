The `rank` command allows users to check their current rank based on XP within your Discord guild using Juniper Nexus Bot.

## Command Usage

To check your rank based on XP, use the following command:

```
/rank
```

## Permissions

-   **Required Permissions**: None (available to all users within the guild).

## Command Behavior

-   Upon executing the command, the bot responds with a loading message while fetching the user's rank.
-   If the guild context is not available (e.g., if the command is executed outside a guild), the bot notifies that the command can only be used within guilds.
-   The bot retrieves the guild's leaderboard (top 100 users based on XP) and finds the user's position.
-   If the user is not in the top 100, the bot notifies that the user is not in the leaderboard.
-   The bot displays the user's rank, level, XP, and time spent (converted to a readable format).

## Example

To check your current rank in the guild based on XP:

```
/rank
```

## Notes

-   This command helps users track their progress and standing within the guild based on XP accumulation.
-   Users can see their level, XP earned, and time spent participating in activities within the guild.
