The `leaderboard` command allows users to view the server's XP leaderboard within your Discord guild using Juniper Nexus Bot.

## Command Usage

To view the XP leaderboard, use the following command:

```
/leaderboard
```

## Permissions

-   **Required Permissions**: None (available to all users within the guild).

## Command Behavior

-   Upon executing the command, the bot responds with a loading message while fetching the XP leaderboard.
-   If the guild context is not available (e.g., if the command is executed outside a guild), the bot notifies that the command can only be used within guilds.
-   The bot retrieves and displays up to 10 top users based on their XP levels and ranks them in descending order.
-   If the leaderboard is empty (no users with XP data), the bot informs that the leaderboard is empty.
-   The leaderboard displays each user's rank, display name, level, and XP accumulated.

## Example

To view the XP leaderboard for your guild:

```
/leaderboard
```

## Notes

-   This command is useful for showcasing active members or users with high XP contributions within the Discord guild.
-   Users can gauge their progress relative to others and strive to climb the leaderboard through active participation.
