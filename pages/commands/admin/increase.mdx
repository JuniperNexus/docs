The `increase` command allows administrators to add coins to a user's balance, associated with a specific event, within your Discord server using the Juniper Nexus Bot.

## Command Usage

To increase a user's coins with an event association, use the following command format:

```
/increase <user> <amount> <event>
```

-   `<user>` (required): Mention or specify the user to receive the coins.
-   `<amount>` (required): The number of coins to add to the user's balance.
-   `<event>` (required): The name of the event associated with the coin increase.

## Permissions

-   **Required Permissions**: Administrator (default member permission).

## Command Behavior

-   Upon executing the command, the bot responds with a loading message while processing the coin addition.
-   The command checks if the specified user exists in the database. If not found, it informs the user with an error message.
-   It verifies if the specified event exists. If the event is not found, it lists available events and informs the user with an error message.
-   It adds the specified amount of coins to the user's balance in the database, recording the event and the operator (administrator) who performed the action.
-   Upon successful addition, the bot confirms with a success message indicating the amount of coins added to the user and the event associated.

## Example

To increase 100 coins for user @example associated with the "SummerFest" event:

```
/increase @example 100 SummerFest
```

## Notes

-   This command is useful for rewarding users for participation in events or achievements within your Discord server.
-   Ensure you have the necessary permissions (`Administrator`) to use this command effectively.
