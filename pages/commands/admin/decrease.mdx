The `decrease` command allows administrators to reduce the number of coins a user has, with a specified reason, within your Discord server using Juniper Nexus Bot.

## Command Usage

To decrease a user's coins with a reason, use the following command format:

```
/decrease <user> <amount> <reason>
```

-   `<user>` (required): Mention or specify the user whose coins will be decreased.
-   `<amount>` (required): The amount of coins to deduct from the user.
-   `<reason>` (required): The reason for decreasing the user's coins.

## Permissions

## Command Behavior

-   Upon executing the command, the bot responds with a loading message while processing the coin deduction.
-   The command checks if the specified user exists in the database. If not found, it informs the user with an error message.

-   Upon successful deduction, the bot confirms with a success message indicating the amount of coins removed from the user and the reason for the deduction.

## Example

To decrease 50 coins from user @example for the reason "Penalty for breaking rules":

```
/decrease @example 50 Penalty for breaking rules
```
